    3) You can apply a single rule to multiple selectors by separating the
    selectors with a comma. <br />
    4) You can use both an iu can apply a single rule to multiple selectors by separating the
    selectors with a comma. <br />
    4) You can use both an id and a class to select an element in a single rule
    b and a class to select an element in a single rule
    by combining the id and class selectors with a "#" and "." respectively. For
    example, to select an element with an id of "title" and a class of
    "primary": #title.primary<br />
    5) The descendant combinator (represented by a space) in CSS allows you to
    select an element that is a descendant of another element. For example, "div
    p" would select all p elements that are inside of a div element.<br />
    6) A rule that uses one class selector has higher specificity than a rule
    that uses three type selectors. Specificity is a value assigned to a CSS
    selector, the higher the value the more specific the selector is considered.
    A class selector (.) has a higher specificity value than a type selector
    (e.g. div, p, h1).<br />
    7) The order of box-model properties is: content, padding, border,
    margin.<br />
    8) The box-sizing CSS property allows you to control how the dimensions of
    an element are calculated. By default, the box-sizing property is set to
    "content-box", which means that the element's dimensions are calculated
    based only on the content within it. Setting box-sizing to "border-box"
    includes the element's padding and border in the calculation, making the
    element's dimensions include these properties.<br />
    9) The standard box model in CSS defines the dimensions of an element as the
    sum of its content, padding, and border. The alternative box model, called
    "box-sizing: border-box" includes the element's padding and border inside
    its defined width and height.<br />
    10) Margin is used to create more space between two elements.<br />
    11) Padding is used to create more space between the contents of an element
    and its border.<br />
    12) Margin is used if you want two elements to overlap each other. <br />
    13) A block element is a type of element that takes up the full width of its
    parent container and creates a new block formatting context. Examples of
    block elements include div, h1, and p. An inline element is a type of
    element that only takes up as much width as necessary and does not create a
    new block formatting context. Examples of inline elements include span and a
    tags <br />
    14) An inline element is a type of element that only takes up as much width
    as necessary and does not create a new block formatting context. An
    inline-block element is a type of element that behaves like an inline
    element but also allows you to set a width and height.<br />
    15) h1 is a block element <br />
    16) button is a block element <br />
    17) Div is a block element <br />
    18) Span is an inline element <br />
    19) A flex container is the parent element that holds flex items and
    controls the layout of those items. A flex item is a child element of a flex
    container that can be laid out in a flexible way.<br />
    20) To create a flex item, set the display property to flex on the parent
    element and then add child elements within it. <br />
    21) The shorthand flex property defines the main-axis and cross-axis, the
    flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis properties. <br />
    22) To make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of
    horizontally, set the flex-direction property to "column" on the flex
    container. <br />
    23) Justify-content aligns the flex items along the main axis (horizontally
    by default) while align-items aligns the flex items along the cross axis
    (vertically by default).<br />
    24) To center a div inside a flex container using flexbox, set the parent
    container's display property to flex, justify-content property to center and
    align-items property to center. <br />
    25) The main difference between justify-content: space-between and
    justify-content: space-around is in how they distribute the remaining space
    within a flex container.<br />

    justify-content: space-between will distribute the remaining space evenly
    between the flex items, with the first item being on the start edge of the
    container and the last item being on the end edge of the container.<br />

    justify-content: space-around will distribute the remaining space evenly
    around the flex items, with equal space on both sides of each flex item.
    This means that the first and last items will have half the space before and
    after them as the other items. This option will cause the items to appear
    with some space around them, as if they were surrounded by invisible
    items.<br />
